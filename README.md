## Introduction:

In this 20th century many of us in the technology field have had
converted every little things into automated or machine
operated things. Now coming back from huge world I started
thinking the old traditional way of cooking in a LPG gas stove
or burner. Though there are alternative way of cooking are
also available in this time like induction cooking. In India it is
more likely to find a gas-stove in every 8 out of 10 house.
Keeping in mind with many such cases such as leakage of gas,
forgetting to off the burner in time, over-cooking due to
forgetting about the dish when engaged in a different work,
now this is prototype of a iot based project to ensure that all
possible safety measures are being taken from the gadget itself
to make it easier and helpful for any cooker without having a
tension of anything. Moreover this gadget can be fitted in any
gas-stove out there in the market and can give information
directly to the user in the smartphone app with the sensor
sensing the position of the burner nobe, fire state, fire
intensity, manually controlling of the nobe, setting timer and
to start the fire with just a button tap in the smart-phone.

To make the kitchen with a technically advance I had
proposed this paper which can help user in the following
ways:
1. Gas leakage checking
2. Fire state checking
3. Nobe position
4. Manual control of nobe at desired position
5. Three set position of the nobe
6. Timer
7. Two option can user take when the timer goes down:
 a) To set nobe at low
 b) To put the burner off
